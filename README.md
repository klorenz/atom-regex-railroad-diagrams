**_Please Note:_** This fork was created to fix minor bugs related to changes in the Atom Editor API (v1.13+). It is not under active development and other than necessary fixes is unchanged from original repo/package.th

A regular expression railroad diagram view for regular expression 
under cursor.  This is still in development and for me it is a test of
graphics capabilities of Atom.

It also shows you a parsing error message, if your regex is not syntactically
correct.

For now it only supports most common regex features, but there are more 
to come.
